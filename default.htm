		<h1>Introducing Kansas City Hacker Homes...</h1>
		<div id="accordion">
			<h3><a href="#top">Our Mission</a></h3>
			<div>
				To further the business community in Kansas City by offering 3 months of rent-free, Google Fiber-connected startup space to entrepreneurs, provided by volunteer KC homeowners.
			</div>
			<h3><a href="#top">Want to Hack a Startup in KC?</a></h3>
			<div>
				Thank you so much for your interest in hacking KC! Our goal is to "match-make" you with a potential homeowner where you can stay for free for 3 months while building your kickass startup on Google Fiber!<br />
				<br />
				The agreement between each homeowner / hacker is different, but generally you can expect the following... <br />
				<br />
				What you'll get:<br />
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Free room & board</li>
					<li>Free utilities</li>
					<li>Free Google Fiber (depending on location) </li>
					<li>Introduction to the <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2011/09/as-part-of-big-5-chamber-aims-to-make-kc-most-entrepreneurial-city" target="_blank" >entrepreneurial culture in KC</a></li>
					<li>Support from the community for your startup</li>
					<li>Awesome friendships</li>
				</ul>
				What is expected of you:<br />
				<br />
				<ul>
                	<li>You pay this kindness forward</li>
                	<li>You're extremely grateful to the homeowner during your free stay</li>
                	<li>You pay for your own food</li>
                	<li>You kickass on your startup idea</li>
				</ul>
				At the end of 3 months, you will have the option to take one of several "on-ramps" to formalize your business space and will move out of the hacker home to allow another hacker to take your place. These on-ramps are still a work in progress, will be purely optional and only exist only to further assist you in making your business successful. <br />
				<br />
				Again: KC Hacker Homes only exists as a match-making service to pair you up with a homeowner and for you to form a temporary living arrangement with them. We are not part of the "deal" between you and the homeowner in any way. <br />
				<br />
				<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDQzWDFSV2VwTTRmUWxDb1VWRDFwRHc6MQ#gid=0" target="_blank">I'm interested - Sign me up!</a>
			</div>
			<h3><a href="#top">Want to be a Hacker Host?</a></h3>
			<div>
				Being a "Hacker Host" can be extremely rewarding. You will be supporting the local business community by helping a new startup get off the ground. You will meet new and interesting entrepreneurs from all walks of life. You will be bombarded with ideas and conversations about new ways to tackle challenges. You will make new friends. <br />
				<br />
				Being a host is really easy. Simply show us you're interested by completing the form linked below. We'll contact you and begin a simple matchmaking process to make sure all your questions and concerns are answered. You'll eventually get a chance to talk with the hacker we've elected for you. Then when you're both ready, they move in!<br />
				<br />
				The agreement between each homeowner / hacker is different, but generally you can expect the following... <br />
				<br />
				What you'll be responsible for: <br />
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Room & board</li>
					<li>Utilities</li>
					<li>Introducing the newbie to KC</li>
					<li>Showing Midwestern kindness to a total stranger</li>
				</ul>
				The Hacker-Entrepreneur staying with you is expected to: <br />
				<br />
				<ul>
					<li>Pay this kindness forward</li>
					<li>Build a new startup business in Kansas City</li>
					<li>Buy their own food</li>
				</ul>
				At the end of 3 months, you would have the option to quit the program, take on a new startup hacker or keep your existing one, depending on how you feel. <br />
				<br />
				Please note: KC Hacker Homes only exists as a match-making service to pair you up with a hacker and for you to form a temporary living arrangement with them. We are not part of the "deal" between you and the hacker in any way. <br />

			<h3><a href="#top">Is There a Cost Involved?</a></h3>
			<div>
					No. This service is entirely free for both hackers and hacker-hosts. The reason why we're doing this is to encourage startups to move into the KC area and to make Kansas City and better place to live and work. We do not receive funding from anyone. 
			</div>
			<h3><a href="#top">Why Move to Kansas City?</a></h3>
			<div>
				<ol>
					<li><b>The People</b><br />Good, hard-working, laid-back, good-humored Midwesterners. That's the reputation of people in Kansas City and it's well deserved. People are a company's greatest asset but also it's greatest liability. <b>Great people make great companies - they don't just happen by accident</b>. If you're starting up your business from scratch, do yourself a favor and seed it from the ground up with solid individuals. Each stellar employee yields an exponential of 10 less things you need to worry about.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><b>The Cost</b><br />Doing business in Kansas City is cheap. Kansas and Missouri have all kinds of tax write-off wars to tempt businesses over to their side of the KC border. The <a href="http://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_result.jsp?country=United+States&amp;city=Kansas+City%2C+MO">cost of living is below the national average</a> and the cost of office space is way below what is charged near the coast at only <a href="http://www.loopnet.com/Kansas-City_Missouri_Market-Trends">$83 a square foot</a> (at time of writing). The salaries of employees <a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/kansas-city-salary-SRCH_IL.0,11_IM437.htm">are also very reasonable</a>, since there isn't a huge cost of living to offset.<br /><br />When bootstrapping a startup, every needless expense is a big deal. There's much more bang for your buck in Kansas City.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><b>The Culture</b><br />Haven't heard of the <a href="http://www.big5kc.com/">Big 5</a> in KC? The Chamber of Commerce <a href="http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2011/09/as-part-of-big-5-chamber-aims-to-make-kc-most-entrepreneurial-city">vowed to make Kansas City the most Entrepreneurial City</a> in the US, in 5 years. A lofty goal to be sure. But the results is that the thriving startup culture in KC is well-supported, well-liked and highly-encouraged by the community.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><b>The Fiber</b><br />If your business has any reliance on connectivity, you should pay attention to <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">Google Fiber</a>. The business rates for Google Fiber haven't been released yet, but you can guarantee they'll smash the current current rate out of the water. Instead of paying $500 a month for 100MBps, you can already get a personal Google Fiber connection for 10 times as fast and a 7th of the cost.<br /><br />Online businesses have fought for years to minify their HTML, squeezing precious seconds from load times and bandwidth costs. Keep doing that. Then serve it up on Google Fiber.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><b>The Location</b><br />Kansas City is centrally located to the entire US. If you're a business that ships from a single warehouse, it makes sense to put that warehouse in KC. You'll be saving on gas and vehicle maintenance for years to come in addition to providing faster turnaround times for customers.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><b>The Impact</b><br />Ever wondered what it was like to be in Silicon Valley during the early rise of Apple and Microsoft Getting into the fledgling KC support scene now gives you a strategic long-term advantage for future growth.<br /><br /></li>
					<li><b>The Talent Pool</b><br />Unlike cities on the west coast and other tech hubs, the talent pool in KC has a long way to go before being depleted. There may not be the density of PhD students as in some places, but the techies that are here are much easier to find and easier to persuade to join your startup efforts. There also isn't a lot of talent poaching going on, so your mind can rest easier that the people you hire will stay there for longer. <br /><br /></li>
